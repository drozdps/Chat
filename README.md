 <h1>Chatter web-application developed by Paul Drozd for course project at Belarussian State University</h1>

 ## Description
 
Project designed and implemented for master's degree course "Enterprise Software Engineering" at Belarussian State University by Paul Drozd (drozdps@gmail.com, skype: paul_drozd). I used following literature while working on the project:
* https://www.apress.com/br/book/9781484228074 - common information about Spring framework
* https://www.apress.com/br/book/9781484229842 - description of Java Big Data techinques I used in the project

 ## Features
 
* User registration (via the sign up page /registration).
* Separation of authorities (admin and usual users). Only admins can create chat rooms. 
* 2 supported languages: English and Russian. A user can switch between languages on any page.
* Chat rooms functionality: a user can join any chat room he(she) likes. A user can see other users in a chat room. 
* Public (broadcast) messages: a user can send a message in a chat room so any users of the same room will be able to read the message.
* Private message: a user can select another user and send private messages to him, so other users will not be able to read their conversation.
* Long-term message history
* Distributed database Cassandra. I used Apache Cassandra database as a long-term vault for user messages. It supports Big Data technologies and works extremely effectively in this project. The database restores previous messages when a user logs into the system:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS message (username text, date timestamp, fromUser text,  roomId text, toUser text, text text, PRIMARY KEY ((username, roomId), date)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (date ASC)
```
* In-memory key-value database Redis, which I used to store rooms with users so a User can quickly join or leave any group.
* Sophisticated security with Spring Security Framework. All passwords are encrypted
* MySQL was used as the main database storing following tables:

* Beautiful and user-friendly UI. I used JSP+Thymeleaf to build all pages
* Fast external message broker

## Patterns and architecture

* Complex Big Data technologies with Cassandra+Redis+external message broker
* Full support of all SOLID principles (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SOLID)
* MVC pattern: separation of concerns using Spring Framework (each page has JSP file for UI, wired Spring controller and corresponding model and DAO classes).  A controller returns a logical view name and the view selection with the help of a separate ViewResolver.
* Dependency injection and inversion of control. I inject Spring Beans in the Spring IOC container which is responsible for the objects creation, wiring the objects together, configuring these objects and handling their entire lifecycle.
* Proxy pattern. This is a structural pattern that is used by Spring framework to generate special objects to interface the functionality of inner objects to the outer world.
* Front Controller Design pattern. The front controller design pattern is a technique in software engineering to implement centralized request handling mechanism which is capable of handling all the requests through a single handler. Spring framework provides support for the DispatcherServlet that ensure to dispatch an incoming request to your controllers.
* Singleton. All Spring Bean defined in spring config files are singletons by default.
* Factory. Used for loading beans through BeanFactory and Application context.
