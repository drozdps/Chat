 <h1>Chatter web-application developed by Paul Drozd for course project at Belarussian State University</h1>

 ## Description
 
Project designed and implemented for master's degree course "Enterprise Software Engineering" at Belarussian State University by Paul Drozd (drozdps@gmail.com, skype: paul_drozd). I used following literature while working on the project:
* https://www.apress.com/br/book/9781484228074 - common information about Spring framework
* https://www.apress.com/br/book/9781484229842 - description of Java Big Data techinques I used in the project

 ## Features
 
* User registration (via the sign up page /registration).
* Separation of authorities (admin and usual users). Only admins can create chat rooms. 
* 2 supported languages: English and Russian. A user can switch between languages on any page.
* Chat rooms functionality: a user can join any chat room he(she) likes. A user can see other users in a chat room. 
* Public (broadcast) messages: a user can send a message in a chat room so any users of the same room will be able to read the message.
* Private message: a user can select another user and send private messages to him, so other users will not be able to read their conversation.
* Long-term message history
* Distributed database Cassandra. I used Apache Cassandra database as a long-term vault for user messages. It supports Big Data technologies and works extremely effectively in this project. The database restores previous messages when a user logs into the system:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS message (username text,
								   date timestamp,
								   fromUser text,
								   roomId text,
								   toUser text,
								   text text,
								   PRIMARY KEY ((username, roomId), date))
WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (date ASC)
```
